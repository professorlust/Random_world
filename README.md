# Random_world
An opportunity to explore git through a personal side-project of mine: a fantasy world generator.

Goals:
1. To create lists of random first, middle,
   last, and consonant word blocks

2. To generate a list of people, set their names
   as variables belonging to class person, and
   set some random attributes for those people
3. To be able to (somehow) access these people
   and view their attributes.
4. (meta) to learn and apply oop.
