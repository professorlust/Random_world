To do: figure out exactly how to take
in the value of x from pop_generator
in main.py and get it to assign that
to a variable. oop is something I
really, really will have to work at as
it isn't coming nearly as easily as
procedural programming did.

This is the key, and the biggest
issue with the state of my current
skills as a programmer -- I have to
become well-acquainted with classes
until I understand them instinctively.
I'm committing this, but hopefully
I'll have this figured out two commits
from now!
